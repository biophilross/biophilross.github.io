      <description>Curriculum vitae I am a protein biochemist by training, but a biologist with broad interests that range from the atomic to organismal scale in principle. I have a B.S. in Bioengineering from Binghamton University and a Ph.D. in Genetics from the University of Chicago.
As a computational biologist in the lab of Manuel Llin√°s, I contributed to studies of transcriptional regulation in Plasmodium falciparum, which inspired me pursue a Ph.</description>

Molecular immunology in the Adams Lab
During my Ph.D. in the Adams Lab, I worked mainly on two proteins that play important roles in the innate and adaptive immune response: the archaic HLA-B*73:01 and the non-classical HLA-F. Both molecules serve as ligands for polymorphic Killer-immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), but it was unclear exactly how.
In the case of HLA-B*73:01, it was clear that similar to other class I molecules, HLA-B*73:01 presents short peptides to receptors that may either allow or prevent receptor recognition.</description>
